As a student, studying brain anatomy was quite challenging in that every part was named and no one really explained the significance of it. As a gorwn-up expert, I still feel a sense of doubt about all the time and energy I spent trying to memorize every single structures. And here I decided to give some takeaway summary.

## <span style="color:blue"> Brain Surface Anatomy </span>
In clinician's perspective, I've summarized what I think is important, clinically.

### Ways to find a central sulcus
Central sulcus(CS) is clinically extremely important in that precentral gyrus is directly related to patients motor function. There are several other techniques that I didn't mention but these are enough based on my experience. Also knowing only one technique isn't enough cause in most real-world situations, it's challenging than you think.

 - superior frontal sulcus & precentral sulcus: It's supereasy to find a superior frontal gyrus(SFG). The outermost and highest gyrus is SFG and the sulcus right lateral to it is superior frontal sulcus(SFS). SFS runs posteriorly and makes a right anle with precentral sulcus. Sulcus located just behind it is CS. But as you can see in first image above, seems like there is a sulcus in the middle of SFG and these kind of things make you confused.
 - pars bracket: In the medial view, marginalis sulcus is a extension of cingulate sulcus. And both left and right marginal sulci creates a bracket-looking from above. CS lie- right in front of this bracket. However, as can still be seen in the example above, the two marginal sulci do not necessarily meet to form a straight line.
 - hook sign: This sign may seem quite subjective, but still reliable sometimes. If you're still not sure that sulcus you're currently looking at is CS, keep in mind that central sulcus do not meet in the middle and resembles the hook(or omega or maybe question mark).

### Frontal lobe
![Frontal Broca's area](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7c3f1e62-0fd6-4ed5-908d-1fae9d44f2f0)

Anatomically, frontal lobe consists of superior, middle, inferior frontal gyrus laterally and cingulate gyrus medially. But clinically speaking what is more important is which one is dominant hemisphere and whether the disease extended to language cortex(Broca's area). So knowing the location of pars triangularis & pars opercularis(which consists Broca's area) is all you need to know. c.f. most people show left hemisphere dominance(>90%), but in left-handed individuals, the probability drops to 70-80%(still the majority are left hemisphere dominant).

### Temporal lobe

Since understanding the anatomy of temporal lobe requires lots of sense of spatial orientation, it's always hard to get a real 3D image of temporal lobe. Before start, you need to consider it as a triangular pyramid lying on its side(apex of it is temporal pole). Rather than remembering all the names of sulci, focus on the gyrus. 
Medial side of pyramid is rolled like a scroll to make hippocampus. As you can see from above image, temporal horn of lateral ventricle is located laterally, connecting to ambient cistern medially. The temporal choroid plexus is located on the roof of the continuing pathway.

### Parietal & Occipital lobes
Of course they have clinical significance themselves but knowing the location of particular sulcus(e.g. calcarine sulcus) is another thing. I believe it's ok to understand the gross function of it and skip them for now. And simple arachnoid cyst will not be discussed here.

## <span style="color:blue"> Normal Variants </span>
Normal variants are clinically important without a doubt in that it helps you be confident when it comes to reassuring your patient.

### Perivascular space
![PVS with penetrating artery](https://prod-images-static.radiopaedia.org/images/1066/82467510bceaf97ae86d3d2b8001caa1cfff63377f08f6727b2e1afa98899d9b_big_gallery.jpeg)
*Gaillard F, Perivascular space. Case study, Radiopaedia.org (Accessed on 16 Jun 2025) https://doi.org/10.53347/rID-2643*

Also known as Virchow-Robin space, is a space between arteries and pia mater of brain which believes to be a normal variant. SInce the space is filled with fluid(interstitial), it shows the signal intensity of CSF and you can often find an artery lying in the middle. 
Common sites are as follows: 
 - basal ganglia, thalamus
 - subcortical white matter, periventricular white matter, subinsular region(never involve cortex)
 - midbrain
 - corpus callosum

### Choroidal fissure cyst / hippocampal remnants cyst
![choroidal fissure cyst](https://prod-images-static.radiopaedia.org/images/240303/f474e1950b60bf4f68423bd84a8d9f_big_gallery.jpg)
*Gaillard F, Choroidal fissure cyst. Case study, Radiopaedia.org (Accessed on 16 Jun 2025) https://doi.org/10.53347/rID-8384*

*Silva G, Hippocampal sulcus remnant cysts. Case study, Radiopaedia.org (Accessed on 16 Jun 2025) https://doi.org/10.53347/rID-35606*

Another cystic lesions named and diagnosed based on its location. Also follows the signal intensity of CSF.

### Mega cisterna magna
![Mega cisterna magna](https://prod-images-static.radiopaedia.org/images/58965797/31531556644e069af260cf74e05a22abfc8c895e79561a0b952bbbca857679e4.jpg)
*Gaillard F, Walizai T, Campos A, et al. Mega cisterna magna. Reference article, Radiopaedia.org (Accessed on 16 Jun 2025) https://doi.org/10.53347/rID-4585*

Also, another cystic lesion that is considered to be a mild form of Dandy-Walker syndrome(cerebellar hypoplasia). Unlike DWS, cerebellar hemisphere and vermis should be seen in mega cisterna magna and has no clinical symptoms. Sometimes it's difficult to distinguish with retrocerebellar arachnoid cyst(often shows occipital scalloping). However if there are no symptoms, there is no need to make a distinction.

### Ventricle variants
![cavum septum pellucidum & cavum vergae](https://prod-images-static.radiopaedia.org/images/2034945/fc386e73c0b4ef54ea208c2ae00975_big_gallery.jpg)
*Schubert R, Cavum septum pellucidum and vergae. Case study, Radiopaedia.org (Accessed on 16 Jun 2025) https://doi.org/10.53347/rID-18167*
![cavum velum interpositum](https://prod-images-static.radiopaedia.org/images/930496/d2e126e8c03fb89993ad13ed22d373_big_gallery.jpg)
*Schubert R, Cavum velum interpositum cyst. Case study, Radiopaedia.org (Accessed on 16 Jun 2025) https://doi.org/10.53347/rID-13825*

Each side of septum pellucidum or velum interpositum usually fuses to form single septum. However failure to do so creates plural septum pellucidum or velum interpositum, one in each side, leading to vetricular variants. There are several subtypes depending on how far it is attached. Cavum septum pellucidum(cavum septi pellucidi), cavum vergae, cavum velum interpositum.

Additionally, keep in mind that ventricular asymettry can happen up to 20% of people, without any clinical significance. 

### Meckel's cave prominence

### Normal calcifications
![BG calcification](https://prod-images-static.radiopaedia.org/images/16114/ae4b044785cf075b3984ce309124e0_big_gallery.jpeg)
*Gaillard F, Basal ganglia calcification - senile. Case study, Radiopaedia.org (Accessed on 16 Jun 2025) https://doi.org/10.53347/rID-4934*

here are several structures that may show sporadic calcification.
 - Meninges: falx, dura mater, tentorium cerebelli
 - pineal gland & habenula
 - choroid plexus
 - sagittal sinus
 - petroclinoidal ligament
 - basal ganglia 

### Normal iron deposition
![BG iron deposition on GRE](https://prod-images-static.radiopaedia.org/images/54510219/53._big_gallery.jpeg)
*Kabra U, Neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation. Case study, Radiopaedia.org (Accessed on 16 Jun 2025) https://doi.org/10.53347/rID-87358*

Likewise, iron deposition may be observed in certain anatomical structures. 
 - globus pallidus
 - dentate nucleus
 - midbrain(substantia nigra, red nucleus)

### Others
Other conditions that may seem abnormal but happens in normal population.
 ![asymmetric Meckel cave enlargement](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9042f136-2d5e-4ad7-ad88-71fc524cdbdb)
 *Wright JN, Wycoco V. Asymmetric Meckel Cave Enlargement: A Potential Marker of PHACES Syndrome. AJNR Am J Neuroradiol. 2017 Jun;38(6):1223-1227. doi: 10.3174/ajnr.A5140. Epub 2017 Apr 13. PMID: 28408631; PMCID: PMC7960085.*
 - asymmetric Meckel cave enlargement: Bony indentations may differ between the two sides.

 - cavernous sinus fat: This can be seen in 20-30% of normal population. Check HFU to see if it's air created by trauma or not.

 - cortical hyperintensities in T2, FLAIR sequence of 3T MRI: insula, orbitofrontal cortex, cingulate gyrus, corticospinal tracts(including superior cerebellar peduncle). However, true lesions show reduced ADC values(e.g. ischemic damage), whereas pseudolesions do not. Will attach a copyright-free image if I find one.
